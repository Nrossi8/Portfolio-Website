          Here are some of the projects and experiences that reflect my interests in cybersecurity,
          problem-solving, and development. I’ll continue adding more as I grow.

            <h2>Detecting &amp; Preventing Phishing Using Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
              A group project focused on using machine learning techniques to classify URLs as phishing
              or benign. We worked with Python, data preprocessing, and models from scikit-learn using
              real phishing datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project explores feature extraction from URLs, model evaluation, and how this type of
              tool could support security teams in detecting phishing attempts faster.

			<h2>National Cyber League Challenges</h2>
			<p>
			Through NCL, I’ve worked on challenges involving OSINT, password cracking, log analysis,
			network traffic inspection, and web-based vulnerabilities — the same kinds of skills used by red and blue teams.
			</p>
			<p>
			These challenges strengthened my ability to think like an attacker while staying grounded in
			documenting steps, explaining findings, and approaching problems methodically.

            <h2>Personal Portfolio &amp; Web Projects</h2>
            <p>
              This portfolio itself is a project: built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on
              clean structure, responsive design, and presenting my cybersecurity journey clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also worked on earlier web projects, including an app for my AP Computer Science Principles
              class that allowed users to look up ratings for different dog breeds.

            <h2>Future Security Labs &amp; Tools</h2>
            <p>
              I'm actively planning more projects, including security lab environments, log analysis practice,
              and small tools to automate or support defensive tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I complete them, I'll link and document new projects here and on my GitHub.
