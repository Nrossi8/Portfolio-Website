          <p>
            I’m Nicolas Rossi, a Cybersecurity student at Pace University in New York City. I’m working toward
			a future role as a penetration tester, and I enjoy learning how attacks work so they can be found,
			understood, and fixed.
          </p>
		  <p>
			I still value blue team concepts like detection, monitoring, and incident response, because they help
			me see the full picture: how defenders think and how attackers are caught.
		  </p>
          <p>
            I’m also building a strong foundation in business, communication, and teamwork, which helps me
            connect technical work with real-world impact.
          </p>
